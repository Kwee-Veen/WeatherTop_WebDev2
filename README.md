# WeatherTop v2

This API-assisted web app allows users to create accounts, create weather stations and upload weather data.
Weather readings and forecasts at user-defined locations can be automatically generated through OpenWeather® API integration.
User-submitted and API-generated weather data are both processed automatically, presenting an dynamic overview for each station.

This is the Release version of the 'Weathertop v2' assignment, written by Caoimhín Arnott.  
Developed with Node.js using the Express framework (JavaScript) for MVC-based web apps, coupled with the Bulma framework (CSS).
